      Hello everyone, in this webpage I am going to explain about the topic:
      "Electrical activity of heart (ECG)".

      <h2>What is ECG?</h2>
      <ul type="square" inputmode="Hello">
        <li>
          ECG is a diagnostic test used to detect the electrical activity of the
          heart.
        </li>
        <p>
          <li>
            As electrical impulses pass thought the heart , the electrical
            spread current spread into the tissues surrounding the heart and
            <em
              >and small portion of these currents spread into the surface of
              the body</em
            >
          </li>
        </p>

            <strong>
              These signals are sent by a group of cells in the right atrium of
              the heart known as the sinoatrial node (SA node): the primary
              pacemaker of the heart, and they spread through the heart muscle
              tissue as tiny electrical impulses.
            </strong>
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>
                An ECG measures these changes in electrical signals (or, in fact, voltage) on different areas of skin and plots them as a graph
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>
                Time Measurements and Heart Rate Measurements are made horizontally on electrocardiogram.
