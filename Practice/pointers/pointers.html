                <mark>Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable</mark> .They allow direct
                access and manipulation of memory, enabling dynamic memory allocation, efficient array handling, and
                function argument passing by reference. Pointers are declared using the * operator, and they are
                powerful
                tools for advanced programming tasks.

                    A NULL pointer can be assign a value NULL at the time of declaration.

                            <br><br>int *ptr = NULL;

                <p>
                    In C programming, a void pointer is also called as a generic pointer. It does not have any standard
                    data type. A void pointer is created by using the keyword void. It can be used to store an address
                    of any variable.
                    <code>
                            <br><br>void *ptr = NULL ;
                        </code>

                <p>
                    A pointer is said to be a wild pointer if it is not being initialized to anything. These types of
                    pointers are not efficient because they may point to some unknown memory location which may cause
                    problems in our program and it may lead to crashing of the program. One should always be careful
                    while working with wild pointer
                    <code>
                            <br><br>int *ptr ;

        <h2 id="double pointer">Double Pointer(pointer to pointer)</h2>
        <p>
            A double pointer, or a pointer to a pointer, is a variable that holds the address of another pointer.
            Essentially, it points to a memory location that contains another pointer, which in turn points to the
            actual data. It's often used in complex data structures and dynamic memory allocation.
        </p>
        <img src="doublePointEr.png" alt="doublePointer img">
        <p>
            Here variable arr will give the base address, which is a constant pointer pointing to the first element of
            the array, arr[0]. Hence arr contains the address of arr[0] i.e 1000. In short, arr has two purpose - it is
            the name of the array and it acts as a pointer pointing towards the first element in the array.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Pointers and Function">Pointers and Function</h2>
        <p>
            In C programming, it is also possible to pass addresses as arguments to functions. <br><br>

            To accept these addresses in the function definition, we can use pointers. It's because pointers are used to
            store addresses. <br><br>

            Like normal variable, pointer variable can be passed as function argument and function can return pointer as
            well. <br><br>
            There are two approaches to passing argument to a function: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Call by Value</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Call by value is a method of passing arguments to a function where a copy of the actual value is passed.
                Changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original value.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="CallbyValue.png" alt="callbyvalue">
            <li>
                <h3>Call by Reference</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Call by reference is a method of passing arguments to a function where the function receives a reference
                (address) to the actual variable, not just a copy. This means that any changes made to the parameter
                inside the function will directly affect the original variable.</p><br>

        <h2 id="Storage">Storage Classes</h2>
        <p>
            In programming, storage classes define the scope (visibility) and lifetime of variables and functions. Here
            are the four main storage classes in simple terms:
        <ul>
            <li>Automatic (auto):</li>
            <p>
                Scope:
                Local to the function/block where it's defined.<br>
                Lifetime: Exists until the function/block execution ends.<br>
                Example: Local variables inside a function.</p>
            <li>Static</li>
            <p>
                Scope: Local to the function/block, but retains its value between function calls. <br>
                Lifetime: Exists for the entire duration of the program. <br>
                Example: Static variables inside a function. <br>

                <li>External</li>
            <p>Scope: Global, available to all functions in all files (if declared properly). <br>
                Lifetime: Exists for the entire duration of the program. <br>
                Example: Global variables/functions declared with extern.</p>
            </p>

            <li>Register</li>
            <p>
                Scope: Local to the function/block where it's defined. <br>
                Lifetime: Exists until the function/block execution ends.<br>
                Special Note: Suggests storing the variable in a CPU register for fast access.<br>
                Example: Frequently accessed local variables.<br>
